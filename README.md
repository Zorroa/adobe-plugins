## Requirements

- Premiere Pro version 14.3.0
- CEP 9

This extension was built for Adobe's version of the Chrome Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses a React frontend and GraphQL middleware which brokers data from the ZMLP API.

Youâ€™ll need to set an Adobe preference to prevent your host application (Photoshop, Premiere, etc.) from throwing alerts about unsigned extensions.

> Windows: Openregedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.8, then add a new entry PlayerDebugMode of type "string" with the value of "1".

> Mac: In the Terminal, type: defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1

Installing extension. Create a symlink to local instance of this project.  
`ln -s <FULL PATH TO LOCAL REPO> /Users/{USERNAME}/Library/Application \Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/zmlpext`
Note\* Create the CEP directory if it's missing from the Adobe folder.

Navigate to project and run `npm install` at it's root. This will install module dependencies for both graphql & premiere-ext, then build their distribution files.

You can then open Adobe Premiere, start a new project, and then navigate to Window > Extensions > Zorroa Visual Intelligence. Navigate to Settings and enter your credentials to begin.
